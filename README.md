## Python Data Structures Exercise

In this exercise, you’ll get to practice your Python syntax and use of common Python data structures.

We’ve provided you with 40 small coding challenges, along with a few harder further study problems.

All of our problems have function stubs with docstrings. Read these carefully to see how the function should work.

Our docstrings contain snippets of Python code which can be used to run tests to check if your function operates as it should. To run these “doctests”:

```bash
$python3 -m doctest [filename].py
```

Make sure all of the tests pass!

(We’ll talk more officially about testing in Python later.)
